## Blackjack
This is a basic console application that allows a user to play the game, Blackjack or TwentyOne. Through the use of methods I was able to create a dealer, deck, and shuffled cards as well as implement logic to create the game rules associated with black jack.

## Car Insurance
This project was created through the design pattern MVC in Visual Studio and is a basic representation of a car insurance website. Through the use of business logic, a user's quote is calculated based off company policies. I also added an admin page that displays only certain user data to said admin.

## NewsLetter MVC
This is an MVC web application that creates a database for a mailing list. It collect's the user's name and contact information, then stores it in a table. It includes an admin page with functionality to view and/or remove the user from the mailing list.
